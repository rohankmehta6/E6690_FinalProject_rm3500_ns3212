Statistical Analysis of Cloud Datacenter Workloads


The dataset contains the performance metrics of 1250 VMs from a distributed datacenter from Bitbrains for one month duration at interval of 5 minutes for each observation (i.e. approximately 8600 observations per VM).

We have focused our problem on studying following four features over one month period as a time series:
* Percentage CPU usage
* Percentage memory usage
* Total Disk I/O
* Total network bandwidth I/O

We applied some statistical learning models on each of these four parameters over a period of time and then figured out which model works best for a particular parameter.
* Polynomial Regression
* ARIMA
* Prophet (by Facebook)

Conclusions
* Polynomial regression fits nicely as we increase the order. However, this gives us absurd and impracticable future predictions. Clearly, this can be explained by the phenomenon of overfitting.
* Prophet model generally outperforms ARIMA model when it comes to predicting future resource usage.
    - It is also less complicated to use as compared to ARIMA.
* We need more data, preferably at least for 1 year, so that we can make more accurate predictions for resource utilization.
    - Prophet model usually advocates to use data of 1 year duration.
